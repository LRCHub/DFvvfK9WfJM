Then I cc'ed every girl that I'd see, see 'round town

And hate to see y'all frown, but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back?

Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night, stole the light from the sun
Would not burn me on my bum when I shoot the moon

High jump the broom like a pre-me out the womb
My partner yellin', "Too soon, don't do it"
Reconsider, read some literature on the subject
You sure? Fuck it

You know we got your back like chiropractic
If that bitch do you dirty, we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry, hurry go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya

Keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart
Hey keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls are smart, three stacks, these girls are smart
Play your part, play your part

My bitch a choosin' lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoe's get the most, not the lesser

Trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot

I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn head
Some hoe's wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy

Oh, I choose you, girl

Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the seven wonders of the world
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl

When I say my girl, I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin' up the paper on the dinin' room table
'Cuz you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable

We rock the freshest sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich

Easy as A, B, C, simple as 1, 2, 3
Get down with ugk, Pimp C, B you N B
'Cuz what's a hoe with no pimp? And what's a pimp with no hoe's?
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin' to get chose

Oh, I choose you, girl

Eeny meeny decisions with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit' girl
Don't touch my projection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life

That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
'Cuz it's gonna get wetter, better prepare you for the c-support
She supposed to spend in on that baby but we see she don't

Ask, ask Paul Mccartney, the lawyers couldn't stop me
Slaughter, slaughter them pockets had to tie her to a rock and
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
'Cuz he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eatin' good

Like an infant on a double D titty, just gettin' plump
'Cuz you miscalculated the next to the, the last pump
Dump, dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up
Better choose the right one or pick, pick the kiddies up

Oh, I choose you, girl
I choose you, baby
