They're like little foxes on the run
I don't think they're having much fun
I'm too tired on my own
And tonight how bright you shone.

Standing over the bridge now
The wind's good
And this is what it feels like

You will come around again
You will come around again

I will find you there living in the desert heat
I will find you there with another kind of girl
You're gonna come around
You're gonna come around

I can't believe what I see. You outshine
I am ready for this to be our time

Standing I'm over the bridge now
The wind's good
Standing I'm over the bridge now
The wind's good
And this is what it feels like:

You will come around again.
You said I should try patience
It feels good

They're like little foxes on the run
I don't think they're having much fun
