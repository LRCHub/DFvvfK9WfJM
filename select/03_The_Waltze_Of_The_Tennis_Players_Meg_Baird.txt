The reason I get so upset
When you talk this assuredly
Is where on earth is it leading?
The cowboys have trouble with reading
The mistletoe is leaving her head on your shoulder
My, my, my

Your love for me
Is an overnight sensation
My love for you
Is an overnight sensation, too

Constance - what a name!

Your love for me
Is an overnight sensation
My love for you
Is an overnight sensation, too

And the mushrooms are growing
In every new bootprint
My, my, my

Your love for me
Is an overnight sensation
My love for you
Is an overnight sensation, too
